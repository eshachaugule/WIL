<center> <font color = "black"> <h2>Anandibai Gopalrao Joshi</h2>
</font> </center>

<p>Born in 1865 in an extremely orthodox Brahmin family in
Maharashtra, a 9 year old girl got married to a widower who was almost
thrice her age. Sounds like a normal ''old Indian saga''? Not really!
The girl later on became the first Indian woman to qualify as a
doctor. Even though she died at a very young age of 21, she opened the
gates for many young women in India who wanted to do much more than
devoting their entire life to household chores. Yes, we are talking
about Anandi Gopal Joshi, India's first lady to qualify as a doctor
from the USA in 1886.</p>

<p>You go to a hospital and a lady doctor is there to attend to you.
Doesn't look like an unusual scenario, right? But back then in the
nineteenth century, it was nothing less than a miracle. Even today,
India is struggling with a major dearth of doctors, especially female
doctors. At present, nearly 66 percent of the health workers are men.
Only 17% of all allopathic doctors and 6% of allopathic doctors in
rural areas are women. According to the paper ''Human resources for
health in India'', published in the British Medical Journal 'Lancet',
1 in 5 dentists are women while the number stands at 1 in 10
pharmacists.</p>
<p>
If this is the condition in the current scenario, where we believe
India is progressing rapidly and women are getting equal
opportunities, just imagine what would have been the condition at the
time when Joshi dared to go out of her way to pursue medicine.

We all hear about how people fight against the masses and make their
mark. In the glory and the success we often fail to recall the efforts
of other people who made it possible for them. Every superhero has his
army of helpers and we have this army in real life too in the form of
family, friends, mentors etc.

Gopalrao Joshi, Anandi's liberal husband is one such person who stood
by his wife's side and acted as her biggest inspiration and push.
Gopalrao, a postal clerk, was determined to educate his wife when she
expressed her wish to study medicine at the age of 14, after losing
their first child just 10 days after delivery because of
unavailability of proper medical resources.
</p>
<p>
At a time when women's education wasn't taken seriously, Gopalrao
appeared as a great exception. He had married Anandi on the condition
that he should be permitted to educate the girl and that she should be
willing to read and write.

Gopalrao started teaching Anandi how to read and write Marathi,
English and Sanskrit. He also transferred himself to Calcutta to avoid
direct interference of Anandiâ€™s parents in her education.
</p>
<p>
When some parts of India still deal with unsupportive husbands and a
society that thinks a woman's place is inside the house, the story of
the couple is a fresh change. We don't know if Gopalrao was too harsh
on his wife and whether his obsession was justified. All we can say is
his support for women's education and their empowerment was remarkable
for the time he lived in.

Though she could not convert her degree into a successful profession
due to her untimely death, Anandibai surely left a mark on India's
heart and contributed to a much better, and bolder, India.

Anandi was already ill with the first symptoms of the tuberculosis
that would ultimately kill her. Her health worsened when she returned
to India in 1886. She received a grand welcome and The princely state
of Kolhapur appointed her as the physician-in-charge of the female
ward of the local Albert Edward Hospital.

Anandi died a few days after it. She passed away on 26th February
1887, a month before turning 22. Her ashes were sent to Mrs.
Carpenter, her host in America who placed them in her family cemetery
near New York.
