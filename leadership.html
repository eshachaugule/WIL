<p>
Women are gradually making their leadership presence felt in
entrepreneurship, administration, education, engineering, health, etc.
at regional, national, and global levels. Women are now resolved to
break the traditional glass ceiling that barred them from entering
leadership positions even if they possessed requisite skills and
talent to occupy them.
</p>

<p>
Women are constantly evolving and reaching new milestones across a
wide spectrum of human activities in modern times. The world has
witnessed the advent of women leaders such as Hillary Rodham Clinton,
Indra Nooyi, Oprah Winfrey, Theresa May, Christine Lagarde, to name a
few.

<center> <font color = "black"> <h2> WHAT IS LEADERSHIP? </h2> </font> </center>

<p>
Every organization needs a leader, irrespective of its size and
functions. A leaderless organization is a "muddle of men and machine";
a country without leadership is anarchy; a society without leadership
is a violent and dangerous place to live. Then, what is the meaning of
leadership? What constitutes leadership?
</p>
<p>
A leader is a person who influences and encourages a group of people
to work towards the realization of goals. The hallmark of leadership
is the capacity to influence others towards accomplishing goals and
towards betterment. As Chester Barnard sums it up, “Leadership is the
ability of a superior to influence the behavior of a subordinates or
group and persuades them to follow a particular course of action.”
</p>
<p>
Leadership is not gender-specific. It is a set of leadership qualities
inherent or cultivated in person or persons who develop themselves
into great leaders with mass following. Leaders can be either men or
women.

<center> <font color = "black"> <h2> CHARACTERISTICS OF WOMEN
LEADERSHIP </h2> </font> </center>

In this section, we have highlighted some of the common characteristic
features of women leaders -

 <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
        <li>Transformational Leadership Style</li>
<p>
Women leaders are more transformational than men leaders. They
function as a role model for their subordinates. They inspire their
team and spend a lot of time coaching their team. They care a lot
about their personal development. Women leaders emphasize teamwork and
authentic communication as a key to success. For most women leaders,
leadership is not meant only for accomplishing organizational goals
but for transforming their followers into better people.
</p>

        <li>Task-Focused</li>
<p>
Women leaders are invariably focused on completion of tasks assigned
within deadlines. From an operational point, completing day-to-day
tasks are necessary to ensure smooth functioning of the company.
</p>

<li>Prefer to Work in Collegial Atmosphere</li>

<p>
Women leaders generally prefer leading and creating flat
organizational structures that enables all to work in a collegial
atmosphere interpedently. Flat organizational structure overlooks the
experience and knowledge of seasoned employees and the manager. Women
leaders usually are critical of hierarchical structure of
organization.
</p>

<li>Promote Cooperation and Collaboration</li>
<p>
To work in collaboration with others is a typical feminine
characteristic. Women leaders always promote cooperation and
collaboration amongst the team members. In this case, all the members
of the team need to be clear of their roles and responsibilities,
otherwise, it results in redundant work.
</p>

<li>Communication Style</li>
<p>
Women leaders tend to be participatory and possess a democratic style
of leading people. They seem to abhor ‘command and control style’
practiced by male leaders. Women often times indirectly communicate
their expectations of a given task and allow more space in
accomplishing a goal. It sometimes helps the team members use their
skills and expertise to complete the task, however, at other times it
can be a drawback if the assigned task requires a leader to have
direct communication with the members.
</p>

<li>Self-Branding<li>
<p>
Unlike their male counterparts, women leaders often appear to be
modest or silent about their own accomplishments. They are seldom good
at branding themselves. However, it is necessary that women leaders
learn how to brand themselves by sharing their achievements and skills
with others. Unless people know or notice what they are capable of,
they cannot recognize the leadership qualities of a women leader.
</p>
</ul>

<center> <font color = "black"> <h2> WOMEN IN LEADERSHIP - IMPORTANCE
</h2> </font> </center>
<p>
Any institution, whether it is society or organization, in the present
century cannot function effectively without women’s equal
participation in leadership activities. Women create a perspective
that brings to competition and collaboration to organizations and
teams.
</p>
<p>
In today’s world, organizations that are led by inclusive leadership
teams make effective decisions that deliver better result. In the
twenty-first century, the essential qualities required to lead include
the ability to collaborate, connect, empathize and communicate. All
these qualities are feminine in nature and can help build a more
sustainable future.
</p>
<p>
Many statistics show that companies led by women have better financial
results. Leadership by women is vital to increase the pace of societal
transformation at home and in the workplace. Women leaders are likely
to provide an integrated view of work and family, resulting in an
engaged and promising personal and professional future.
</p>
<p>
Gender parity in leadership is important because true progress cannot
happen without a diversity of perspective in leadership roles.

<center> <font color = "black"> <h2> REPRESENTATION OF WOMEN IN
DIFFERENT SECTORS </h2> </font> </center>
<p>
Representation of women in different sectors refer to the percentage
of women employees working in various sectors. In the past, women were
grossly underrepresented in politics, businesses, education,
manufacturing, science and technology, etc. However, this situation is
changing steadily.
</p>
<p>
In the US, women are 50.8 percent of the total population. They earn
almost 60 percent of undergraduate degrees and 60 percent of all
master’s degrees. They do fairly well in law, medical degrees,
business administration and management. Women account for 47 percent
of the US labor force and 49 percent of the college-educated
workforce.
</p>
<p>
Women in the US account for 52 percent of the professional-level and
middle-management jobs. However, they lag substantially behind men
when it comes to their representation in leadership positions. While
45 percent of the overall S&P (Standard and Poor’s) and 37 percent of
first or middle level officials and managers in those companies, they
are only 25 percent of executive and senior-level official manager.
</p>
<p>
In the legal field, they are 45 percent of associates but only 20
percent of partners and 17 percent of equity partners. In the medicine
sector, women comprise 35.5 percent of all physicians and 26 percent
of permanent medical school deans. In case of academia, women are only
30 percent of full professors and 26 percent of college presidents. In
politics, women represent only 6.2 percent of the total members of
Congress, whereas in the UK 19.4 percent of Members of Parliament are
women. They are only 12 percent of governors and only 17 percent of
the mayors of the 100 largest American cities. In the UK, 30.8 percent
of local councilors are women.
</p>
<p>
The above-mentioned facts and figures, though indicate a rise in women
representation in different sectors, it shows that women
representation in decision-making positions is far from being
satisfactory. Much remains to be done to increase the number of women
at strategic and decision-making positions.
