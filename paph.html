<p>
Mary Teresa Bojaxhiu(26 August 1910 – 5 September 1997), commonly
known as Mother Teresa and honoured in the Catholic Church as Saint
Teresa of Calcutta, was an Albanian-Indian, Roman Catholic nun and
missionary. She was born in Skopje (now the capital of North
Macedonia), then part of the Kosovo Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire.
After living in Skopje for eighteen years, she moved to Ireland and
then to India, where she lived for most of her life.

Mother Teresa was born as Anjezë Gonxhe Bojaxhiu Albanian on August
26, 1910, in Yugoslavia. After having lived in Macedonia for 18 years,
she moved to Ireland and then to India.
</p>
<p>
1928 At 18, future Mother Teresa decided to follow the path she was
unconsciously trudging throughout her life; began her religious life
in Ireland.
</p>
1929 Sent to Darjeeling to the novitiate of the Sisters of Loreto.
</p>
<p>
1931 Made the first vow, chose the name of Teresa, honoring both
saints of the same name, Teresa of Avila and Therese of Lisieux.
</p>
<p>
1931 Starting from 1931, she taught history and geography for 15 years
at St. Mary’s School in Calcutta.

1931 When she became a nun in 1931, she named herself ‘Teresa’. She
chose this name to honour her patron saint.
</p>
<p>
1950 Founded the Missionaries of Charity, a Roman Catholic religious
congregation, in 1950. It comprises over 4,500 sisters and is active
in 133 countries.
</p>
<p>
Works of the Missionaries of Charity: They run hospices, schools,
homes for people with HIV/AIDS, and orphanages; 19 homes in Kolkata
alone

Vows of Missionaries of Charity: One must adhere to the vows of
chastity, poverty, and obedience, as well as a fourth vow, to give
“wholehearted free service to the poorest of the poor”.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
2003 Pope John Paul II beatified Mother Teresa; the beatification
process was the shortest in modern history. Her official title is now
Blessed Teresa of Calcutta.
</p>
<p>
2016 The Vatican has scheduled September 4, 2016, as the canonisation
date for Blessed Mother Teresa.

The call from God For years, Mother Teresa refused to talk about the
moment when she decided to devote herself to the service of the poor.
But once she said, “God called me to surrender myself to his service.”

Hour of darkness She often bemoaned the “dryness,” “darkness”,
“loneliness” and “torture” she was undergoing. She compared the
“experience” to hell, and said that it drove her to doubt the
existence of God.
</p>
<p>
The road to sainthood

1 A bishop investigates facts of the person’s life to determine
whether s/he is deemed worthy of consideration.

2 The church official must prove that the candidate a life of heroic
virtues. For this, documents and testimonies related to the person’s
life are collected and presented to the Congregation for the Causes of
Saints in Rome. After the nod, he/she earns the title of “Venerable”.

3 To be beatified and recognised as “Blessed”, one miracle acquired
through the candidate’s intercession is required in addition to
recognition of heroic virtue. In 2002, the Vatican recognised as a
miracle the healing of a tumour in the abdomen of an Indian woman,
Monica Besra, after the application of a locket containing Mother
Teresa’s picture. Besra said that a beam of light cured her cancer.

4 Canonisation requires a second miracle after beatification though
the Pope may waive these requirements. A miracle is required before
the canonisation. On December 17, 2015, the Pope recognised second
miracle attributed to her involving healing of a Brazilian man with
brain tumours.

5 Once the second miracle is received through the candidate’s
intercession, the Pope declares the person a “Saint”.
</p>
<p>
Criticism English journalist Christopher Hitchens, one of her
formidable critiques, said Mother Teresa treated the symptoms of
poverty while ignoring the causes, and that “she was not a friend of
the poor. She was a friend of poverty”.

She is also accused of accepting money from corrupt political leaders
and rich fraudsters without publish any accounts.

She was widely criticised and called a “religious fundamentalist” for
calling abortion as “the greatest destroyer of peace”

Some missionaries and journalists accused her of poor medical
standards at her hospices in Kolkata.
