<p>
Here we will go through some unknown facts about Nita Ambani who is
one of the richest women in India and we can also get a glimpse of her
journey from a middle class Bharatnatyam dancer from Gujarat to
becoming one of the most powerful women in India.

Nita Ambani hails from a middle class Gujarati family and her name by
birth was Nita Dalal.
</p>
<p>
Nita Ambani's father Ravindrabhai Dalal was a senior executive of the
Birla group. Nita Ambani was a graduate in Commerce from Narsee Monjee
College of Commerce and Economics, and she started teaching until her
luck brought her in touch with Mukesh Ambani.
 </p>
<p>
Nita Ambani is a trained Bharatnatyam dancer and her amazing dancing
performances often took her around India. During one of her
performances, Mukesh Ambani's late father Dhirubhai Ambani started
liking her and decided to make Nita Amabani the wife of his son Mukesh
Ambani.

Nita Ambani accepted the proposal, but it was on a condition that she
will be allowed to continue her profession as a teacher.</p>
<p>
Nita Ambani said that for almost 17 years, she preferred to choose
away even after being Mukesh's wife. But now she is the main spearhead
in driving the Dhirubhai Ambani International School since 2013 and
the school has become one of the most popular educational institutions
in Mumbai.
