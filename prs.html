<p>From humble beginnings to being the cause clbre of a gender

sprint event at the Olympics.</p>

<p>''I want to remain who I am and compete again,'' Dutee Chand said
less than two years ago, setting in motion a chain of events that saw
her getting banned as an athlete, becoming the cause célèbre of a
gender struggle, winning a case against the International Amateur
Athletic Federation (Iaaf) and now, in a happy conclusion to the tale,
becoming the first Indian woman to qualify for a sprint event at the
Olympics.
</p>
<p>
On 25 June, Chand won the silver in the women's 100m sprint at the
Kosonov Memorial International Athletic Meet in Almaty, Kazakhstan,
clocking in at 11.24 seconds, well within the Olympic qualifying
standard of 11.32 seconds.
</p>
<p>
Along the way, she broke the national record in 100m twice.

''It really is a wonderful feeling,'' Chand said over the phone from
Almaty. ''In 2014, I was confused and depressed. I had been thrown out
of the national camp. I was being taunted and shamed. And now I'm
going to the Olympics. It's amazing.''

The first thing Chand did after winning the race was to send a
WhatsApp message to her sister, Saraswati, in Bhubaneswar, Odisha.
</p>
<p>
''Olympic ke liye qualify hua,'' the message said. Saraswati, who was
a national-level sprinter before she settled into a police job, sent
the news to her parents in Chaka Gopalpur, a village that is a 2-hour
drive from Bhubaneswar. When she finished her shift, she rode her
scooter back to her village to join in the celebrations.

It was also a day of redemption for Chand's coach, Nagpuri Ramesh, who
had worked tirelessly to train her and get her ready for a shot at
Olympic qualification, even as the athlete went through her ordeal and
found it impossible to rejoin the national camp for Olympic hopefuls.
